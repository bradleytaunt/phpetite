# How to generate this blog

Get [PHPetite](https://github.com/bradleytaunt/phpetite "PHPetite at Github") to convert Markdown&nbsp;files into a single HTML file with inline, compressed CSS.

1. Write posts in `/content`
2. From the command-line run:

```.bash
bash build.sh
```

This will generate both the single file HTML page, along with an `atom.xml` file for the use of an optional RSS feed.

## Advanced options

Looking for more advanced configurations, such as creating custom pages, editing homepage content and styling? Take a look at the [Github repo](https://github.com/bradleytaunt/phpetite "PHPetite at Github") or the official website [phpetite.org](https://phpetite.org "PHPetite").

Thank you, have a nice day.
