# A Single File Blog

PHPetite (/p/h/pəˈtēt/) is a single file, static blog generated from PHP. Based off the very minimal and awesome <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cadars/portable-php">portable-php</a>

You can edit this homepage content in `content/_pages/home-content.md` (or remove it entirely). The choice is yours.
